##Description

User management system - able to create, list, edit, and delete users stored in mongodb. Will be able to save each user's email address and phone number (cannot change email address once it is saved).

##How to Use
Download project to local directory. Install mongodb: https://github.com/Banno/ux_onboarding Open terminal and run `npm install` in your local directory. Project connects to `localhost:1820`.

Can test controllers, directives, services with unit tests and can test the application with e2e tests. Need to run `webdriver-manager start` and `protractor test/protractor.conf.js` to run the e2e tests. Unit tests are run with the `gulp` command.
